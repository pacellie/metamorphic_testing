# Team MT â€“ Metamorphic Testing Framework


## Individual Contributor Setup
- Run `poetry install` to install all requirements.
- Run `poetry run install-hook` to install a Git pre-commit hook which performs linting before you commit.

## CI / CD Setup Steps
- People working on enabling CI / CD related features need access to the repository settings in GitLab so that they can enable runners.
- You need a standard Linux server instance to enable an own runner, as the LRZ doesn't provide one.
- Go to Settings > CI / CD and under Runners > Specific runners, follow the instruction on how to connect your server.
- You just need the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to be in your project root for pipelines to appear in the navbar under CI/CD > Pipelines. For details on the CI configuration see the [GitLab documentation on this](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html) or the [Quick Start Documentation for CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/). Some things you can do include
    * Run commands in a Docker container
    * Group them up by "services"
    * Run some services only on specific branches (e.g. only publish on the main branch)
    * Specify a JUnit output file to get failing tests and coverage info


## Available poetry Scripts
- `poetry install`: Install all dependencies
- `poetry run pytest --capture=tee-sys`: Run tests (with outputs)
- `poetry run cov`: Run tests with coverage and show results
- `poetry run lint`: Run linters. Equivalent to `poetry run prospector`. This will automatically check with mypy, pylint, bandit and some other tools.
- `poetry run install-hook`: Install Git pre-commit hook to lint before committing


## Linting in VSCode
- You can have Visual Studio Code check your linting automatically by adding the following to `.vscode/settings.json` (which is .gitignore-d):
    ```json
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": false,
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.prospectorEnabled": true
    ```

This way you should see linting and typing errors directly in your editor, which is way more convenient.


## Publishing a New Version
- Increase the version number in pyproject.toml following the suggestions on https://semver.org/
- Push into your branch, then create a merge request into main
- Wait for the pipelines to finish, then let someone merge your PR
- After it's merged and the tests have run through again, go to CI/CD > Pipelines, then press the button to publish. This step has to be done manually so that you cannot publish on accident.
